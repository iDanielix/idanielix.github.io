          Persona 3 follows a group of high school students trying to cope with,
          understand and accept death in a world surrounded by it, as well as
          find their own reasons for living. They form a group called SEES in
          order to investigate the Dark Hour, a mysterious time period between
          one day and the next that few people are aware of. During the Dark
          Hour, SEES explores Tartarus, a large tower containing Shadows,
          creatures that feed on the minds of humans. To fight the Shadows, each
          member of SEES is able to summon a Persona, a manifestation of their
          inner self.

              The protagonist of Persona 3, is a transfer student enrolling in
              Gekkoukan High School in Iwatodai City. He is an orphan whose
              parents died on the Moonlight Bridge in their car during a fatal
              incident a decade prior to the game. The protagonist's canon name
              is Makoto Yuki. The name originates from the movie adaptation of
              the game, but the canonicity of both the names and the media it
              was in was dubious. The name would become canon starting from its
              use as the default name in the 2023 re-release of Persona 3
